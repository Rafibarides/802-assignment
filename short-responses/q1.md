# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
Making API requests with API keys from the frontend exposes your keys to the public, risking unauthorized use and potential security breaches. Making requests from the server keeps keys hidden from users, mitigating this risk.
